MOBILE SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER
=============================

This file represents where your mobile.png should be.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Create or obtain a mobile screenshot (375x667px recommended)
2. Name it exactly: mobile.png
3. Place it in this /images/ folder
4. Delete this PLACEHOLDER-mobile.txt file

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
-------------------
If you need to test the site before you have screenshots, you can:

Option 1: Use a placeholder image service
- Replace src in index.html:
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/375x667/0a192f/00d9ff?text=Mobile+Screenshot">

Option 2: Use desktop screenshot (will work but not ideal)
- Copy desktop.png and rename to mobile.png
- The site will work, just won't look perfect

Option 3: Use browser DevTools

- Press F12, then Ctrl+Shift+M (device toolbar)
- Select iPhone or Android device
