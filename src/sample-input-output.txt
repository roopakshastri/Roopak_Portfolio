PROJECT 1 (Web Application Security)
========================================

REPLACE_PROJECT_1_TITLE → Vulnerable Web App Penetration Test
REPLACE_PROJECT_1_SHORT_DESCRIPTION → Comprehensive security assessment of an intentionally vulnerable web application, identifying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and providing remediation guidance.
REPLACE_PROJECT_1_FULL_DESCRIPTION → 
    Conducted a full-scope penetration test on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to practice 
    identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities. The assessment included reconnaissance, 
    vulnerability scanning, manual testing, and exploitation of SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure 
    authentication, and file upload vulnerabilities. Documented findings in a professional penetration 
    test report with risk ratings, evidence screenshots, and step-by-step remediation recommendations. 
    This project demonstrated practical application of OWASP methodology and hands-on experience with 
    Burp Suite, SQLMap, and custom Python scripts for automation.

REPLACE_PROJECT_2_TITLE → Network Security Monitoring Lab
REPLACE_PROJECT_2_SHORT_DESCRIPTION → Built a home lab environment to practice network traffic analysis, intrusion detection, and firewall configuration using open-source tools.
REPLACE_PROJECT_2_FULL_DESCRIPTION → 
    Designed and implemented a virtualized network security lab using VirtualBox with multiple VMs 
    (pfSense firewall, Security Onion IDS, Ubuntu server, Kali Linux attacker). Configured network 
    segmentation, firewall rules, and Snort IDS signatures to detect common attack patterns. Simulated 
    various attack scenarios (port scanning, brute force, DoS) and analyzed captured traffic using 
    Wireshark. Created custom detection rules for malicious activity and generated alerts. This project 
    provided hands-on experience with network defense strategies and real-time threat monitoring.

PROJECT 3 (Penetration Testing)
========================================

REPLACE_PROJECT_3_TITLE → HackTheBox CTF Challenges
REPLACE_PROJECT_3_SHORT_DESCRIPTION → Solved 15+ HackTheBox machines demonstrating skills in enumeration, privilege escalation, and exploit development.
REPLACE_PROJECT_3_FULL_DESCRIPTION → 
    Completed various HackTheBox Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges ranging from easy to medium difficulty. 
    Techniques employed included network enumeration with Nmap, web application fuzzing, exploiting 
    misconfigurations, privilege escalation via kernel exploits and SUID binaries, lateral movement, and 
    post-exploitation data extraction. Each machine was documented with detailed write-ups including 
    methodology, tools used, commands executed, and lessons learned. This project showcased practical 
    penetration testing skills and the ability to think creatively to overcome security obstacles.

========================================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
========================================

❌ Leaving placeholder text in visible content
❌ Using different names/emails in different files
❌ Forgetting to update js/main.js project data
❌ Using real email in mailto if you don't want spam (consider using contact@yourdomain.com)
❌ Referencing project URLs that don't exist without adding "Coming Soon" or "#"
❌ Using images larger than 200KB (slows page load)
❌ Forgetting to update page <title> and meta description

========================================
