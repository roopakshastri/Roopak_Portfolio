✓ "WCAG 2.1 AA compliant"
✓ "Keyboard navigation throughout"
✓ "ARIA labels and roles for screen readers"
✓ "Color contrast ratios meet standards"
✓ "Focus indicators on all interactive elements"

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
✓ "Deployed to [GitHub Pages / Netlify]"
✓ "Automatic SSL certificate provisioning"
✓ "Continuous deployment from Git repository"
✓ "CDN distribution for global performance"

✓ "Lazy-loaded images"
✓ "Optimized CSS and JavaScript"

===============================================================================
COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
===============================================================================

Q: "Why no frameworks like React or Vue?"
A: "To minimize dependencies and attack surface. Vanilla JavaScript is more
    secure as there's no risk of framework vulnerabilities, and the site
    loads faster without heavy framework overhead."

Q: "How do you handle form submissions without a backend?"
A: "Currently uses mailto for demonstration. In production, I'd implement
    a serverless function or integrate with Netlify Forms for server-side
    validation and processing."

Q: "What's your deployment process?"
A: "Push to GitHub triggers automatic deployment. Changes go live in under
    2 minutes. The workflow is: code → git commit → git push → automatic deploy."

Q: "How did you achieve A+ security rating?"
A: "By implementing all recommended security headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options,
    HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy. Each header provides
    a specific security control."

Q: "Is this production-ready?"
A: "Yes for static portfolios. For applications handling sensitive data,
    you'd add server-side validation, database integration, and potentially
    a WAF layer."

Q: "How long did this take to build?"
A: "[Adjust based on your experience] The initial build took about 12 hours,
    including design, coding, testing, and deployment. Security implementation
    added another 3-4 hours for CSP configuration and header testing."
